## Introduction

This project is designed to help developers practice making various types of HTTP requests and implementing real-life applications using JavaScript. It covers the basics of GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests and provides examples of how these can be used in real-world scenarios.

## HTTP Request Types

### GET

The GET method is used to retrieve data from a server. It is one of the most common HTTP methods.

### POST

The POST method is used to send data to a server to create a new resource.

### PUT

The PUT method is used to update an existing resource on the server.

### DELETE

The DELETE method is used to delete a resource from the server.

## Real-Life Applications

This section includes examples of real-life applications where different HTTP request types are used:

- Fetching user data from an API
- Submitting a form to create a new user
- Updating user information
- Deleting a user account
